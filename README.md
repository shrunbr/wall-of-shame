## Features

- **Webhook ingestion:** Accepts log events via a simple HTTP POST API.
- **GeoIP enrichment:** Automatically enriches source IPs with country, city, ASN, ISP, and more using ip-api.com.
- **Source tracking:** Maintains a database of unique source IPs, including first seen, last seen, and number of times seen.
- **Frontend dashboard:** Displays grouped and paginated lists of source IPs, with country flags and detailed info dialogs.
- **API endpoints:** Query logs, source details, and batch geo info for integration or analysis.
- **Dockerized:** Easy to deploy with Docker.

## Technologies

- **Backend:** OpenCanary, FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL
- **Frontend:** React (JavaScript)
- **GeoIP:** ip-api.com

## ðŸš€ Deployment

:warning: **OpenCanary is a honeypot. If you don't know what that is or what you are doing with this, go research it before moving forward with this deployment. Make sure you deploy this in a secure, segmented environment, preferrably a DMZ, a cloud server or somewhere that is firewalled or seperate from your own network. USE THIS AT YOUR OWN RISK!** :warning:

### All-in-One

Before we can deploy our Wall of Shame we need to modify our `opencanary.conf` file, modify `docker-compose.yml` and setup our environment variables. In the provided configuration FTP, SSH and HTTP are already enabled.

Modify the `opencanary.conf` file first. For a configuration reference please visit [the OpenCanary configuration documentation.](https://opencanary.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starting/configuration.html). Please note, you MUST set a node ID in the `opencanary.conf` file and remove the comment I have there. If you do not do that OpenCanary will not start!

After you have setup your `opencanary.conf` file, go into the `docker-compose.yml` file and comment/uncomment/modify the service ports according to your `opencanary.conf` configuration. Included in `docker-compose.yml` is a configuration for cloudflared to expose the page publicly via Cloudflare Tunnels. If you do not wish to do this or use cloudflared please remove/comment out that portion.

Now that we have that all setup, we can get our environment variables going. To set these up you have two options...

1. Modify everything directly in the `docker-compose.yml` within the `infra/` folder 
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and modify it as needed.

If you have gone with option 1, you need to run `docker compose up -d` within the `infra/` folder to start the stack.

If you have gone with option 2, you need to run `docker compose --env-file ../.env up -d` within the `infra/` folder to start the stack.

### Distributed

You can also have seperate frontend and OpenCanary servers. Located inside of the `infra/` folder are two docker compose files, `docker-compose.frontend.yml` and `docker-compose.opencanary.yml`.

As with the All-in-One deployment, we also need to modify our `opencanary.conf` file, modify `docker-compose.frontend.yml` and setup our environment variables.

#### Server #1 (Web Interface/DB)

On your frontend server, setup your environment variables by either copying `.env.example` to `.env` or modifying `docker-compose.frontend.yml` directly. Also included with the frontend docker-compose file is cloudflared, if you do not wish to use cloudflare tunnels to expose this page publicly, comment out or remove that portion.

After you have your environment variables set, you can get the frontend launched by doing one of the following...

If you have modified the environment variables in the docker-compose file, you need to run `docker compose -f docker-compose.frontend.yml up -d` within the `infra/` folder to start the stack.

If you have used the `.env` file (assuming it is still in the wall-of-shame root folder) you need to run `docker compose --env-file ../.env -f docker-compose.frontend.yml up -d` within the `infra/` folder to start the stack.

#### Server #2 (OpenCanary)

Now that we have our web interface and DB server running we can launch OpenCanary on another server.

Go into the `infra/` folder and modify `opencanary.conf` as needed. Under `logger > webhook` there is a URL set to `http://app:8081/api/webhook` by default. Change `http://app:8081` to your web interface server IP/hostname. Please note, you MUST set a node ID in the `opencanary.conf` file and remove the comment I have there. If you do not do that OpenCanary will not start!

For a configuration reference please visit [the OpenCanary configuration documentation.](https://opencanary.readthedocs.io/en/latest/starting/configuration.html). 

After you have setup your `opencanary.conf` file, go into the `docker-compose.yml` file and comment/uncomment/modify the service ports according to your `opencanary.conf` configuration.

Once you have your configuration set to go you can launch OpenCanary, `docker compose -f docker-compose.opencanary.yml up -d`.
